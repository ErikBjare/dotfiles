dotfiles
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles)

Just my dotfiles and a nice script for managing them, based on a previously private home repo.

> *Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home.*  
> \- Carl Sagan


## Usage
Just run `setup.sh` and everything will be symlinked to your home dir.  
If there are collisions with existing files they will be moved to `./backup/`  
*(Always read through random scripts from the internets before executing)*

You should probably skim through this README before using.  
Before using you should probably take the advice of a wise file:

> *"Read me"*  
> ***\- README***
