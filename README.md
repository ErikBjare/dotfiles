dotfiles
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles)

My dotfiles and a nice script for managing them, based on a previously private home repo.

> *Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.*  
> \- Carl Sagan


## Usage
Just run `setup.sh` and everything will be symlinked to your home dir.
If there are collisions with existing files they will be moved to `./backup/`
*(Always read through random scripts from strangers on the internet before executing)*


## Introduction

We all feel strongly for our dotfiles, so why not share our love by sharing them?

These are my dotfiles that I use on a variety of hosts, from my desktop and laptop, to my servers and Raspberry Pi's.
