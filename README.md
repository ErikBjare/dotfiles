dotfiles
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ErikBjare/dotfiles)

Just my dotfiles and a nice script for managing them, based on a previously private home repo.

> *Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home.*  
> \- Carl Sagan

## Usage
Just run `setup.sh` and everything will be symlinked to your home dir.  
If there are collisions with existing files they will be moved to `./backup/`  
*(Always read through random scripts from the internets before executing)*
