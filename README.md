dotfiles
========

Just my dotfiles and a nice script for managing them, based on a previously private home repo.

### Usage
Just run `setup.sh` and everything will be symlinked to your home dir.  
If there are collisions with existing files they will be moved to `./backup/`  
*(Always read through random scripts from the internets before executing)*

### Dependencies
 - XMonad, with xmonad-contrib & xmonad-extras (get xmonad-extras using cabal)
 - dzen2, trayer, suckless-tools
 - xfonts-terminus
 - feh, nm-applet
 - gnome-keyring
 - powerline-patched fonts
 - and more I can't remember...
