The time will come when diligent research over long periods will bring to light things
which now lie hidden. A single lifetime, even though entirely devoted to the sky, would not
be enough for the investigation of so vast a subject. And so this knowledge will be
unfolded only through long successive ages. There will come a time when our descendants
will be amazed that we did not know things that are so plain to them. Many discoveries
are reserved for ages still to come, when memory of us will have been effaced.

Our universe is a sorry little affair unless it has in it something for every age to investigate.
Nature does not reveal her mysteries once and for all.

 - Seneca, Natural Questions,
   Book 7, first century
